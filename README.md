## Community Q;
Optimizing for collab/participation
- keep encouraging folks with a "do it" attitude
- core ethos is being helpful, so kind of help desk
- dont ask permission - just do
- take a call for help as a piece of feedback that can be found
- IDEA: when a big ask put on forum(discourse)
- IDEA: make a issue fro the q's
- IDEA: "When you are getting started here's how to get help" on forum
- Discussions features: RW doesnt want another social place until things that exist
